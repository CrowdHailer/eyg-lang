# Type inference

A Hindleyâ€“Milner (HM) type system is a classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.
Several Algorithms are described for infering HM types. Algorithm W, M 

Various extensions exist, when considering extensions do they leave inference complete without annotations.

- https://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.pdf A good walkthrough, that helped explain to me the fix point
  ```
   * let map = (fix ( map f s.
    (cond (null s) nil
    (cons (f (hd s)) (map f (tl s)))))) in map *)
  ```
- https://gergo.erdi.hu/projects/tandoori/Tandoori-Compositional-Typeclass.pdf A thorough explination of algorithm W vs M
  M is the version when a target type is specified. TODO read compositional type system

  TODO does the mutable version explain effect types
- https://github.com/sdiehl/write-you-a-haskell/blob/master/chapter7/poly/src/Infer.hs Write you a haskell is also good to follow

### Error messages

Error given is dependent on infer order. 
One thing is to move to constrains that might be reorderable. generalise and instantiate make this hard

### Rows


Row types describe Extensible Record and Variant types. They do not define Enums or nominal type

### Recursion
### Recursive data types

Recursion is fairly easily handled using a `let rec` construction and a fixpoint for type inference.
However for trivial inference this only works for types that are not recursive or that are nominal.
This doesn't work for structural typing.

  Part of series including inference. TODO can we explain structural inference.
