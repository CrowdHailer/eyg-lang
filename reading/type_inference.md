# Type inference

A Hindleyâ€“Milner (HM) type system is a classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.
Several Algorithms are described for infering HM types. Algorithm W, M 

Various extensions exist, when considering extensions do they leave inference complete without annotations.

- https://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.pdf A good walkthrough, that helped explain to me the fix point
  ```
   * let map = (fix ( map f s.
    (cond (null s) nil
    (cons (f (hd s)) (map f (tl s)))))) in map *)
  ```

  M is the version when a target type is specified.

  TODO does the mutable version explain effect types
- https://github.com/sdiehl/write-you-a-haskell/blob/master/chapter7/poly/src/Infer.hs Write you a haskell is also good to follow

### Error messages

Error given is dependent on infer order. 
One thing is to move to constrains that might be reorderable. generalise and instantiate make this hard

### Rows


Row types describe Extensible Record and Variant types. They do not define Enums or nominal type
- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scopedlabels.pdf This paper describes Records that have shadowing i.e. overwriting a field leaves it discoverable when a field is removed.

### Recursion
### Recursive data types

Recursion is fairly easily handled using a `let rec` construction and a fixpoint for type inference.
However for trivial inference this only works for types that are not recursive or that are nominal.
This doesn't work for structural typing.

- https://basics.sjtu.edu.cn/~xiaojuan/tapl2016/files/lec8_handout.pdf walks through defining a hungry function. 
  Part of series including inference. TODO can we explain structural inference.
