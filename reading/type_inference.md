# Type inference

A Hindleyâ€“Milner (HM) type system is a classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.
Several Algorithms are described for infering HM types. Algorithm W, M 

Various extensions exist, when considering extensions do they leave inference complete without annotations.

- https://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.pdf A good walkthrough, that helped explain to me the fix point
  ```
   * let map = (fix ( map f s.
    (cond (null s) nil
    (cons (f (hd s)) (map f (tl s)))))) in map *)
  ```

  M is the version when a target type is specified. TODO read compositional type system

### Type vs Kind

Values have types, types have Kinds
Int, Maybe(Int), Fn(Int) -> Int all have kind * (Concrete types)
Maybe has kind * -> * Type constructor

# TODO

- MLsub for recursion
- implement a iso vs equi recursion
- ATSUSHI for rows
- links-lang equirecursive types

### Error messages

Error given is dependent on infer order. 
One thing is to move to constrains that might be reorderable. generalise and instantiate make this hard

### Rows


Row types describe Extensible Record and Variant types. They do not define Enums or nominal type
Seems like implicit Free Row types are kept around, how does this effect caching?

Row extension can be solved by ALWAY being modification, Don't know how this works for unions
If we have unions for effects do we get the same need for tracking nope values. though a union won't crash if meaningless values are matched on which works for now. Is tracking unused branches
the same complexity as keeping a list of not in row labels.
- read details of koka paper to decide this?

### Recursion

hash consing is a technique used to share values that are structurally equal
```
hash("[5,Rec(0)]")
0.[Int, 0.[Int,0]]

overwrite(l = 4, r)

0.[[Some(0) | None]  4]
Some([[0 | None] 4])
```
Which paper always has a rec thing

### Recursive data types

Recursion is fairly easily handled using a `let rec` construction and a fixpoint for type inference.
However for trivial inference this only works for types that are not recursive or that are nominal.
This doesn't work for structural typing.
