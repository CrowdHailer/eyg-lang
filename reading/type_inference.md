# Type inference

A Hindleyâ€“Milner (HM) type system is a classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.
Several Algorithms are described for infering HM types. Algorithm W, M

- https://github.com/wdamron/poly/blob/master/infer.go

Various extensions exist, when considering extensions do they leave inference complete without annotations.

- https://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.pdf A good walkthrough, that helped explain to me the fix point
  ```
   * let map = (fix ( map f s.
    (cond (null s) nil
    (cons (f (hd s)) (map f (tl s)))))) in map *)
  ```

  M is the version when a target type is specified. Too much about classes and subtyping
  W & J essentially the same but call mutable subs map

### Type vs Kind

Values have types, types have Kinds
Int, Maybe(Int), Fn(Int) -> Int all have kind * (Concrete types)
Maybe has kind * -> * Type constructor

# worth further investigation

- MLsub for recursion
- implement a iso vs equi recursion
- ATSUSHI for rows
- links-lang equirecursive types

### Error messages

Error given is dependent on infer order.
One thing is to move to constrains that might be reorderable. generalise and instantiate make this hard

### Rows


Row types describe Extensible Record and Variant types. They do not define Enums or nominal type
Seems like implicit Free Row types are kept around, how does this effect caching?

Row extension can be solved by ALWAY being modification, Don't know how this works for unions
If we have unions for effects do we get the same need for tracking nope values. though a union won't crash if meaningless values are matched on which works for now. Is tracking unused branches
the same complexity as keeping a list of not in row labels.
- read details of koka paper to decide this?

#### An ML-style Record Calculus with Extensible Records

> We present an alternative construction based on the polymorphic record calculus developed by Ohori. Ohori based his polymorphic record calculus on the idea of kind restrictions. This allowed him to express polymorphic operations on records such as field selection and modification

Ohori does not allow extension because no representation of rows without a field

```
{foo = 5, ..b}
b.foo
```

- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scopedlabels.pdf This paper describes Records that have shadowing i.e. overwriting a field leaves it discoverable when a field is removed.

- scoped labels have uses like overwriting color in text env that can be returned to previous value later?
- equality on reordering of labels up to same type

Gaster and Jones [7] presented an elegant type system
for records and variants based on the theory of qualified types [10,
11]. Special lacks predicates are used to prevent records from
containing duplicate labels

In particular, as imposed by MLF, type annotations are only neces-
sary when function arguments of an unknown type are used poly-
morphically.
!!!!

Read MLF or are there other ways allowing may instantiations
I(a) = Int -> Int
I(a) = String -> Int
a = A -> Int
I(a) = String -> String
a = A -> B
My language doesn't allow generic usage of a fn passed in.

Useful way of getting a never type out -> Never type, needed with Effects
Return(Int) | Exp(String)
how is generic function within a record handled in this paper

does always update allow us to drop free row variable?

Total fn type inference
Dhall alpha reduction

Is recursive totality checking same or different to Dhall style inference.

- fn polymorphism not let
- row with only update
- update access
equi/iso ->
- MLF needs annotation for generic parameters

- MLSub vs record stuff
- The scoped approach will work for dropping recursive check in fn, BUT we need to understand equi or not.

Koka structs?
The koka paper talks about automatically opening records

#### Advanced

- https://github.com/owo-lang/MLPolyR
- https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~blume/papers/icfp06.pdf first class cases
  This also talks quite a lot about recursive types

### Recursion

hash consing is a technique used to share values that are structurally equal
```
hash("[5,Rec(0)]")
0.[Int, 0.[Int,0]]

overwrite(l = 4, r)

0.[[Some(0) | None]  4]
Some([[0 | None] 4])
```
Which paper always has a rec thing

### Recursive data types

Recursion is fairly easily handled using a `let rec` construction and a fixpoint for type inference.
However for trivial inference this only works for types that are not recursive or that are nominal.
This doesn't work for structural typing.

### Effect types

## CPS
More of a compilation concern
- https://dev.to/yelouafi/algebraic-effects-in-javascript-part-2---capturing-continuations-with-generators-13da most thorough explaination with continuations
- https://github.com/phenax/algebraic-effects Library using generators and yield does it allow multiple resumption
- https://nythrox.github.io/effects.js/#/algeff Other JS library

Are continuations just first class control flow, do we need to call them effects as that is not really the case for for comprehensions
Can we always CPS style with backpassing and perform is just bumping to the higher level
If I want to handle a promise I need a different API http.get vs task.async(http.get)
