# Interpreters and fast VM's

- [ ] Read crafting interpreters implement in Zig/Go
- [ ] Do lambda lift alpha etc in Eyg
- [ ] pages in standard Eyg interpreter etc in Go/Nim/Zig

need flat tree to implement in EYG without recursive data structures.

there is probably also a standard combination of zipper and datalog query for available actions.
maybe even query to ui elemens that can be manipulated
