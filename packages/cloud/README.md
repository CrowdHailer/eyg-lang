## Secrets

## Connections

Data sources that are cached/pulled

## Channels

Connections that can start a session/chat etc

### Slack

#### Tokens

Slack has multiple types of tokens.

App level tokens (`xapp-`) authorize the app accross all organisations and installs.
They are needed to use [socket mode](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/using-socket-mode)

Configuration token (`xoxe.`) Indicates an expiring access token, with access to read and write apps.

Bot tokens (`xoxb-`) are specific scopes given to an install of the app.
These allow an application to read messages, but only from the channels it is part of.
There is no way to read messages without being added to a channel/group/dm.

#### Setup

To use slack messages as a trigger/channel an [app](https://api.slack.com/apps/) must be created and installed.
A cloud channel is set up with the bot token.
To fetch a bot token the app must have bot token scopes.
If you do not see a "Bot User OAuth Token" check you have created bot token scopes not user token scopes.
Many of the scopes are the same for both bot and user.

A slack trigger is set per conversation and can run any code.
This is separate to the shell/chat access of directly messaging the bot.
shell permissions need to be per channel as well.

#### Storage

All conversations that the bot is part of are streamed into a single event log per workspace.
Ordering and cursor positions are per conversation, that is the only ordering guarantees.
The bot discovers which channels it is part of by polling.

New replies to old threads require separately querying `conversations.replies`. Advancing the channel’s oldest timestamp won’t discover them.
Polling only newer messages misses edits and deletions of older messages.

#### Notes

A slash command triggers an HTTP endpoint.
Editing the slash command message does not rerun the command.
