# Morph

For manipulating programs in more semantic units.

Defines:

- `Editable` as a user friendly representation of program AST's.
It introduces the ability to have multi argument functions, patterns and other constructs.

- `Projection` as an inverted view of program focusing on a specific node and it's surrounding context.

breaks was one of the names of the list of paths
could be context or base as in base of cone
// scope is too near variable scope
// focus as center and context
// zoom has focus and breaks
// loci
target and base
projection
transpose
 path is the list of ints
project onto a surface
target/situation surroundsing
environs/locallity,perifery
district/situation

### Non goals

- inference, loading, running, undo, redo, no mapping from text to position, suggestions, autocomplete
- key bindins to given transforms
