Edition has articles/stories/features/items, which are multiple so not used
instead we say an edition has content. Content could be anything, discounted word was material/subject

periodical/newsletter/publication refer to the total sequence of editions
newsletter sounds like the thing that is shipped to subscribers so the whole thread is called news

Edition is a singal instance issue/volume where other names
Chapters is a subset of an article or somethingelse
almanac as the yearly summary

New issues are added to the archive which is the source of truth,
not called source because articles can have sources
