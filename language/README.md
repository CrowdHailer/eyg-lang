# language

A Gleam implementation of a basic language.

## Quick start

```sh
# Run the eunit tests
gleam eunit

# Run the Erlang REPL
gleam shell
```

## Motivation

Understand what's the simplest useful set of a language and how type algorithms work.

### Type inference

I think that refinement types for handling exhaustive ness might be a kind of subtyping and make the algorithm very slow.
